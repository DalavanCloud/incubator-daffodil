   <!-- 
The tests in this package represent a sampling of some of the basic functionality of a DFDL processor implementation.  
They are not any guarantee of compliance. There are two test files:

    dpaext1.tdml
    dpaext2.tdml     
     
These XML files each contain a number of tests. Each test specifies the data to parse, the expected resultant infoset, and a pointer 
to the DFDL schema. The following XML tags are used:

    parserTestCase - this tag represents one test. It has attributes: 
     
	name  - (must be unique within the full xml file)
	root - the root element of the DFDL schema from which to start processing
	model - the location of the DFDL schema to use
	description - a short summary of the purpose of the tests, including relevant DFDL spec section.
     
    Within the parserTestCase are the document and infoset tags.
     
	The document tag is the input document to be parsed.  In can be in readable text format, or within a documentpart with attribute of type=
	"byte" to provide the value in the hex equivalent form, as this is clearer in showing the input values for things such as binary numbers.
     
	The infoset tag encloses the expected output of the parser, with the tags of the corresponding elements that are parsed using the DFDL
	schema under test.  For string elements, the xsi:type is omitted; for other types it is explicitly provided
   
   
The tests are in order relative to the content of the DFDL specification.  Not all of sections of the specification are covered.  In some cases,
the sample schemas given in the specification are used (made into complete schemas as necessary).

    <!--  The first two tests pick up the samples in Section 1.2.1 of the DFDL specification.  They are here to show
the basic demonstration of DFDL with binary and text number formats  -->


	
	<!--  With lengthKind="delimited", tests show various ways to in indicate the end of an element's content - with terminator, with
	parent separator, with parent of specified length, with end of input. Delimited length can also be used with BCD fields, which
	is shown here.	 Also, an element of explicit length can be a component of a delimited sequence. -->
	
	<!--  A couple of valid logical types are shown with lengthKind="implicit" 	-->
