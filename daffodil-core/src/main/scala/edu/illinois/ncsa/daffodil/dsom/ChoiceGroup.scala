/**
 * Choices are a bit complicated.
 *
 * They can have initiators and terminators. This is most easily thought of as wrapping each choice
 * inside a sequence having only the choice inside it, and moving the initiator and terminator specification to that
 * sequence.
 *
 * That sequence is then the term replacing the choice wherever the choice is.
 *
 * Choices can have children which are scalar elements. In this case, that scalar element behaves as if it were
 * a child of the enclosing sequence (which could be the one we just injected above the choice.
 *
 * Choices can have children which are recurring elements. In this case, the behavior is as if the recurring child was
 * placed inside a sequence which has no initiator nor terminator, but repeats the separator specification from
 * the sequence context that encloses the choice.
 *
 * All that, and the complexities of separator suppression too.
 *
 * There's also issues like this:
 *
 * <choice>
 *    <element .../>
 *    <sequence/>
 * </choice>
 *
 * in the above, one alternative is an empty sequence. So this choice may produce an element which takes up
 * a child position, and potentially requires separation, or it may produce nothing at all.
