Daffodil

========================================================================
INTRODUCTION
========================================================================

Daffodil is a parser generator that follows the DFDL specification.

The generated parsers will translate into XML files that follow the
format described by an XML Schema with DFDL annotations.

It is a command line tool and a Java/Scala library.

========================================================================
REQUIREMENTS
========================================================================

Daffodil requires Java 7 or higher. All other dependencies are included
in the lib directory and are automatically included when running
Daffodil from the command line.

========================================================================
RUNNING
========================================================================

The command line of Daffodil is invoked through a bash script for Linux
and Cygwin, or a batch script for Windows.

To execute Daffodil, run the following command (replacing .sh with .bat
if running windows):

  $ ./bin/daffodil.sh <options>

To display Daffodil usage and options, run the script with the --help
option:

  $ ./bin/daffodil.sh --help

Additionally, the --help option can be used on a subcommand to get
subcommand specific help:

  $ ./bin/daffodil.sh parse --help

  $ ./bin/daffodil.sh test --help

For more information on the command line options, visit the command line
interface page on the Daffodil website:

========================================================================
INTERACTIVE DEBUGGER
========================================================================

Daffodil comes with a built-in interactive debugger, allowing the user
to pause parsing and inspect various aspects of the parse state. To
enable the interactive debugger, supply the global -d option when
parsing, for example:

  $ ./bin/daffodil.sh -d parse --schema examples/pcap/pcap.dfdl.xsd examples/pcap/dns.cap

When running the debugger, the user is provided with a command prompt,
at which point the user can execute debugger commands to control the
debugger and inspect state. Type 'help' at the command prompt to get
information on the debugger commands. Additionally, you can type 'help
<command>' to get help specific to a command.

For more information on the interactive debugger, visit the interactive
debugger page on the Daffodil website:

========================================================================
EXAMPLES
========================================================================

DFDL examples are provided in the examples directory. Examples can be
run using two methods:

1) Using DFDL schemas and input file, for example:

  $ ./bin/daffodil.sh parse --schema examples/pcap/pcap.dfdl.xsd examples/pcap/dns.cap

2) Using a TDML test file, for example:

  $ ./bin/daffodil.sh test examples/pcap/pcap.tdml


========================================================================
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
========================================================================

Setting environment variables may be necessary to allow for
importing/includes to work and when running tdml files.

DAFFODIL_CLASSPATH

  The Daffodil implementation will look on the classpath for 'includes'
  and 'imports', and some tdml files. To define additional directories
  where Daffodil should look for files, set the DAFFODIL_CLASSPATH
  environment variable, for example:

    export DAFFODIL_CLASSPATH="/path/to/imports/:/path/to/includes/"

  In addition to defining directories to search for imports and
  includes, you can add a "CatalogManager.properties" file to the
  DAFFODIL_CLASSPATH to direct Daffodil to a relative path location of a
  user XML Catalog.

DAFFODIL_JAVA_OPTS

  If you need to specify java options specific to Daffodil, you can set
  the DAFFODIL_JAVA_OPTS environment variable. If not specified, the
  JAVA_OPTS environment variable will be used. If that is not specified,
  reasonable defaults for Daffodil will be used.
